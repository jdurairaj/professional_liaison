My name is Jayakanthan Durairaj and also called as Jay. I’m a senior engineering leader with 17 years of experience building and scaling large-scale distributed backend systems across fraud, e-commerce, payments, fulfillment, and banking domains. I’ve designed and delivered high-throughput, highly available platforms that power critical customer journeys — from secure payment processing and fraud detection to promotion engines, rewards, order fulfillment workflows, and financial transaction systems. My experience includes building fraud prevention systems used in global payment ecosystems like Apple Pay and Samsung Pay, as well as architecting enterprise-grade platforms that drive GMV growth, enforce policy controls, and support real-time decisioning at scale. I’ve led multi-location teams of over 23+ full time engineers, built organizations from scratch, and consistently delivered measurable business impact while maintaining strong engineering rigor and reliability standards. In addition to my deep backend and domain expertise, I’m an AI enthusiast actively expanding into LLM-based systems and RAG architectures, focused on applying artificial intelligence in practical, production-grade environments to enhance fraud prevention, personalization, and intelligent automation.
